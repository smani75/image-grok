image-grok
==========

Simple bookmarklet for grabbing images from a site. Upload grok.js and grok.css to your host, insert the domain name at lines 19 && 78 in grok.js and line 1 in grok-bookmarklet.js, and your users are ready to use grok-bookmarklet to grab images. 

This grabs the url of the image and the host name for you (in case they are from different locations) but leaves any and all analytics up to you. Have fun!
